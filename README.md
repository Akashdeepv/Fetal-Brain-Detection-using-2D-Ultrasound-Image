# Fetal-Brain-Detection-using-2D-Ultrasound-Image

Fetal brain detection using deep learning is a technique that uses advanced machine learning
algorithms to analyze ultrasound images of the fetal brain. The goal of this technique is to
identify any abnormalities or anomalies in the fetal brain that may indicate a potential health
issue.
